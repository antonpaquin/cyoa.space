Each pick has a bunch of JSON associated
This is the rules that tell how the "state" changes with each pick
It should be totally reversible
Ideally converted from serverside rules to clientside JS verification
eg.
server, client, user:
c-s: I want a page!
s-c: Here is a page, your initial conditions are ---
u-c: *makes choice*
c-u: that's okay / not okay
u-c: *next page*
s-c: Here is next page, you know your own conditions already

fuck stateless HTML. I should figure out how to do the asynch thing so that the client can track all the state vars

For reversibility, the json should be limited to +- integer quantities
Let's not do changing variables for now (eg. turret cost -= 20)

Only_if rules:
Verify on pick choices in clientside JS
Should default to something like {"money":">cost"}
verification is an only_if at the end of the adventure
And/or should be nestable, so something like
{
  "AND": [
    {"value": "=condition"},
    {"value":">condition"}
  ],
  "OR": [
    {"value":"=condition"},
    {"AND":[
      {"value":"<condition"},
      {"value":"=condition"}
    ]}
  ]
}
