Arbitrary HTML is flexible but not guaranteed to look good or be easy to use.
Instead we have a "layout" model which describes HTML and allows for variables.
Intended usecase is, author describes a layout, then specifies some things that
conform to that layout which will be auto-populated serverside.

Variables are named by $name
No a-zA-Z0-9 and underscores
Any variable named $img_foo is an image tag and should be internally prefixed with whatever magic ruby needs to make uploaded file lookup work
$$ is just a dollar sign '$' to allow escapes

For stage layouts:
pick locations should be denoted by $foo
whereas in the content var they should be identified by their name in a corresponding json list

Authors should define a <foo class="nextButton"></foo> which will be given a link via some jquery fuckery.
Also a angular-like <p class="trackFoo"></p> should be able to auto-update to track certain vars
so <p class="trackCredits"></p> should track the "credits" var
When var is negative, the p class should be given a "negativeValue" class and it taken away when it goes to zero again
Actually look into installing angular to make this work


<div class="blah">
  <p>$var</p>
  <p style="foo">$var2</p>
</div>
<div>
  <img $img_duck/>
</div>

Where the content field would be json like
"{
  "var":"magic duck",
  "var2":"you get a duck",
  "img_duck":"duck.jpg"
}"
